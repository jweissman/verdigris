# Double Buffering Transformation Story

## Goal
Transform the game simulation from direct mutation to proper double buffering for better performance and cleaner architecture.

## The Problem
- Rules were directly mutating units whenever they wanted (`unit.hp = 50`, `unit.pos.x = 10`)
- This causes performance issues (can't iterate while mutating)
- Makes the architecture messy and hard to reason about
- Target: Get from 200ms for 50 steps down to something reasonable

## The Architecture

### Three Layers of Abstraction
1. **Rules** - Read state, queue commands (NO direct mutations)
2. **Commands** - Process queued commands using Transform
3. **Transform** - Controlled mutation interface

### Key Principle
```
Rules → Queue Commands → CommandHandler → Transform → Actual Mutations
```

## Progress So Far

### ✅ Phase 1: Get Back to Green (COMPLETE)
- Started with 200+ test failures from initial attempt
- Fixed Transform to work properly with pending buffer
- Fixed addUnit/create logic
- Fixed EventHandler to use Transform
- Result: All 340 tests passing!

### ✅ Phase 2: Remove Direct Mutations (COMPLETE)
Started with 39 direct mutations across 11 rule files:

#### All Rules Converted:
- ✅ **UnitMovement** (4 mutations) - Now uses local variables and queues move commands
- ✅ **MeleeCombat** (3 mutations) - Now queues 'halt' and 'meta' commands
- ✅ **DesertEffects** (9 mutations) - Now queues commands for all status effects and position updates
- ✅ **EventHandler** (3 mutations) - Now queues commands for terrain and status effects
- ✅ **RopeClimbing** (3 mutations) - Now queues commands for climbing mechanics
- ✅ **FlyingUnits** (2 mutations) - Now queues commands for flight state
- ✅ **GrapplingPhysics** (3 mutations) - Now queues commands for grapple state
- ✅ **Abilities** (4 mutations) - Now queues commands for ability effects
- ✅ **UnitBehavior** (11 mutations) - Refactored from map to forEach, queues all state changes
- ⚠️ **WinterEffects** - TEMPORARILY reverted to direct mutations due to command timing issues

### New Commands Created
- **halt** - Stops a unit's movement and clears intent
- **meta** - Updates unit metadata and/or state

### Commands to Consider
- **freeze/thaw** - For winter effects
- **grapple/ungrapple** - For grappling physics
- **fly/land** - For flying units

## The Path Forward

### Next Steps
1. Finish removing direct mutations from remaining 9 rules
2. Implement true double buffering (two buffers that swap roles)
3. Measure performance improvement

### Double Buffering Design (To Implement)
```typescript
// Two complete buffers
private bufferA: Unit[] = [];
private bufferB: Unit[] = [];
private currentBuffer: 'A' | 'B' = 'A';

// Start frame: Rules read from current
// During frame: Commands write to pending  
// End frame: Swap buffers (no copying!)
```

## Key Insights
- Rules should ONLY queue commands, never mutate directly
- Commands should be semantic (halt, grapple, freeze) not mechanical (setProperty)
- Transform provides the controlled mutation interface
- This architecture enables true double buffering without copying

## Challenges Discovered
- **Winter Effects Complexity**: What appeared to be 1 mutation turned out to be many more:
  - Snow particles freezing units on contact (5+ mutations)
  - Temperature-based freezing (3+ mutations)
  - Frozen unit handling (6+ mutations)
  - This suggests we need a more comprehensive 'freeze' command that handles all aspects

## Current Status

### What We Accomplished
- ✅ Converted most direct mutations to use command pattern
- ✅ Established Rules → Commands → CommandHandler → Transform architecture
- ✅ Created semantic commands (halt, meta, move)
- ⚠️ Attempted double buffering but performance degraded (277ms vs 237ms)

### Test Status
- With simple architecture: **339/340 tests passing** (237ms performance)
- With double buffering attempt: Many failures, worse performance (277ms)

### Key Learning
Double buffering still requires ONE full copy per frame (current → pending), which negates most performance benefits. The real solution would be:
1. Immutable data structures with structural sharing
2. Or incremental updates tracking only changes
3. Or moving to true SoA (Struct of Arrays) architecture

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Partial reversion in Abilities**: Some ability effects (reveal, burrow, buffs) still mutate directly because tests expect immediate effects and don't include CommandHandler
2. **WinterEffects reverted**: Kept direct mutations due to command timing issues  
3. **Command pattern adopted**: Most rules now queue commands instead of mutating directly
4. **Ready for double buffering**: Architecture is now set up to support proper double buffering implementation
