# Verdigris Project Synthesis

## Current Status ✅
**Test Suite**: 329 pass, 10 skip, 15 fail (failing due to incomplete RNG fixes)  

## Project Architecture

### Core Engine
- **Simulation**: TypeScript-based battle simulation engine
- **Performance Target**: <2ms per step, <1s for 350 tests
- **Architecture**: Rule-based system with command queuing and double buffering
- **Visual**: Multiple rendering views (orthographic, isometric, cinematic)

### Key Systems
1. **TargetCache**: Eliminates O(N²) enemy/ally finding operations
2. **PairwiseBatcher**: Consolidates all N² operations into single pass
3. **Command Pattern**: Rules queue commands instead of direct mutations
4. **Double Buffering**: Two buffers (bufferA/bufferB) swap each frame
5. **RNG System**: Centralized seedable RNG for deterministic behavior

### 3. Skipped Tests (10 tests)
**Categories**:
- Rope climbing (6 tests) - feature not implemented, should remove
- Lightning/projectile flaky tests (2 tests) - need deterministic fixes
- Integration tests (2 tests) - need feature completion

## Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
- **Clean separation**: Rules, commands, simulation core
- **Deterministic**: Centralized RNG enables replay/testing
- **Performant**: Meeting sub-2ms targets
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new units, abilities, rules

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Test Organization**: 86 files → 20-30 consolidated files
2. **Command Volume**: Generating 100-170 commands per tick (analyze why)
3. **Memory Layout**: Could benefit from AoS→SoA transformation
4. **Rule System**: Could consolidate winter/desert into scalar fields

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (Red → Green)
1. **Fix RNG in DSL**: Change `sim.rng` to `Simulator.rng` in dsl.ts
2. **Run Tests**: Verify all tests pass after RNG fixes
3. **Address Skipped Tests**: Remove rope climbing, fix 2-3 others

### Performance & Architecture
1. **Command Analysis**: Understand why generating so many commands
2. **Test Consolidation**: Reduce from 86 to ~30 test files  
3. **Memory Optimization**: Consider true AoS→SoA transformation

### Code Quality
1. **Rule Consolidation**: Merge winter/desert effects into scalar field system
2. **Documentation**: Clean up the 11 scattered markdown files
3. **TypeScript**: Address remaining iterator issues

## Key Learnings
- **TargetCache integration successful**: Eliminated major O(N²) bottleneck
- **Performance target achieved**: <2ms per step accomplished
- **RNG centralization critical**: Eliminates test flakiness 
- **Test-first approach works**: Prevented regressions during optimization
- **Command pattern enables determinism**: But generates high command volume

## File Cleanup Needed
These documentation files should be consolidated/removed after synthesis:
- ARCHITECTURE.md (general project overview)
- PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md (now captured above)
- NEXT_STEPS.md (now integrated)  
- TRANSFORM_APPROACH.md (architectural exploration)
- SKIPPED_TESTS_REVIEW.md (tactical plan)
- DOUBLE_BUFFER_*.md (technical analysis)

The core insight is that we've achieved the performance goals but need to complete RNG centralization and address test organization for the next phase of development.
