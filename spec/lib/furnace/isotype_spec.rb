j# we need _some_ spec that flav end-to-end produces expected folk isotypes (which we can bundle into folks.json)

# furthermore it should be a simple 2D array structure with subtypes and tiers, so

describe "Isotypes" do
  describe "S-Tier" do
    # These are quasihero npc ranks for all folk moieties
    # ideally we build up a whole matrix and run flav tasks and say 'it generates the folk with the right ability'
    # Divine (Hero)
    # Occult (Siege Mage)
    # Military (ranked: Infantry -> Lieutenant -> Commander -> General -> Strategist)
    # Religious (Priest -> High Priest -> Hierophant -> Ecumeniphon)
    # Legendary (King -> King of Kings -> Singleton)
    # Nobility (Aristocrat)
    # Criminal (Assassin)
    # Economic (Merchant -> Manufactor -> Magnate)
    # Medical (Healer -> Physician -> Surgeon)
    # Construction (Siege Engineer)
    # Culinary (Field Cook -> Alchemist -> Demolitionist)
    # Creative (Herald -> Singer -> Rock Artist)
    # Government (Diplomat -> Ambassador -> Minister)
    # Toxic (Poisoner -> Diabolist -> Necronomist)
    # The stranger ones
    # Mystery (Sphinx)
    # Agricultural (Farmer -> Rancher -> War Gardener)
    # Scientific (Researcher -> Archivist -> Sage)
