## Original Ideas from Development

### Combat & Animation Polish
- More clear combat mechanics -- go into attack phase with lifecycle, warmup, hit state, recover
- _only_ show combat attack (frame 3) when actually dealing damage; could set a tempvar but better if the renderer can identify 'this happened in the last turn, i should display attack frame'
- Make better/any use of frame 4 (stun/prone) at least for involuntary throw
- Thought/speech bubbles to display current logic?

### Technical Architecture
- Would be nice to organize the specs -- at least isolate true e2es from tests that can run at sim layer entirely?
- More generalization of commands -- ideally the whole sim is driveable through commands?
- Could surface command strings in the sim as we're inputting them somehow
- More backgrounds... maybe more procedurality within the backgrounds
