# Verdigris Architecture Review - Current State vs Vision

## Executive Summary

The TypeScript simulation core is progressing well with strong foundations, but key integration points with the Ruby/Aura pipeline remain disconnected. Performance targets are being met in some areas but the system struggles with scale (2v2 tournament capacity issues).

## ‚úÖ Achievements

### Language & DSL (Ao)
- **Clean PLT design**: Compositional context model with lazy evaluation
- **Efficient caching**: Reduced getAllUnits calls from 101+ to manageable levels (needs verification)
- **Comprehensive testing**: Core specs, performance tests, integration tests
- **Interactive REPL**: `bin/ao` for testing expressions
- **Proper separation**: Language (Ao) cleanly separated from DSL compiler

### Simulation Core
- **784 tests passing**: Well-tested simulation engine
- **Performance**: ~0.3ms per tick for typical scenarios (target: 0.1-0.2ms)
- **2v2 tournament**: Working but hits capacity limits after ~5600 matches
- **Progress reporting**: Graduated frequency for large tournaments
- **Unit arrays**: Structure-of-arrays optimization implemented

### Abilities & Rules
- **26 folk units**: Each with distinct abilities
- **Ability compilation**: DSL-based triggers and targets
- **Rule system**: Modular, command-based architecture

## ‚ùå Gaps vs Architecture

### Critical Missing Pieces

1. **Flav/Aura Integration**: 
   - No connection between TypeScript sim and Ruby generation pipeline
   - Cannot import YAML cardsets generated by Aura
   - No flav tasks for abilities or folk generation

2. **Hero System**:
   - No hero implementation
   - No triple jump/ground pound mechanics
   - No card hand system
   - No controllable character

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - 2v2 tournament fails due to unit array capacity
   - getAllUnits still being called excessively (101 times per tick)
   - Stress test taking 6-8 seconds (should be <5)

4. **Missing Features**:
   - No segmented creatures (dragon)
   - No megabeast system
   - No environment-specific mechanics
   - No visual backgrounds or parallax

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix getAllUnits Performance (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// Problem: Abilities rule calls getAllUnits 101 times
// Solution: Properly implement cached units compilation
```

### 2. Fix Unit Array Capacity
```typescript
// Problem: 2v2 tournament crashes after 5600 matches
// Solution: Implement proper cleanup/pooling
```

### 3. Bridge to Flav Pipeline
```yaml
# Need flav task for ability generation
# app/generates/ability.aura
ability:
  name: ${name}
  trigger: ${trigger_expression}
  target: ${target_expression}
  effect: ${effect}
```

### 4. Test Flav Integration
```ruby
# Verify folk generation matches expected structure
# scripts/test_folk_generation.rb
```

## üìä Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Tests | 784 | 1000+ | üü° |
| Sim tick performance | ~0.3ms | 0.1-0.2ms | üü° |
| getAllUnits calls/tick | 101 | <10 | üî¥ |
| 2v2 match capacity | ~5600 | 123,201 | üî¥ |
| Flav integration | 0% | 100% | üî¥ |
| Hero system | 0% | MVP | üî¥ |

## üöÄ Next Sprint Priorities

1. **Fix Performance Blockers**
   - Resolve getAllUnits excessive calls
   - Fix unit array capacity for tournaments
   - Optimize stress test to <5 seconds

2. **Flav Integration MVP**
   - Create ability.aura generator
   - Create folk.aura generator  
   - Test YAML ‚Üí TypeScript import pipeline
   - Verify folk isotypes match expected abilities

3. **Hero System Foundation**
   - Basic controllable unit
   - Jump mechanics (single ‚Üí double ‚Üí triple)
   - Ground pound ability
   - Card draw simulation

4. **Synergy Analysis**
   - Complete 2v2 tournament run (26C2 combinations)
   - Generate synergy matrix
   - Identify optimal team compositions

## üìù Technical Debt

1. **DSL Compiler**: Still creating new contexts per unit evaluation
2. **Unit Arrays**: No proper pooling/recycling mechanism
3. **Test Coverage**: Missing flav integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Ao language needs formal spec
5. **Performance**: Many optimization opportunities remain

## ‚ú® Bright Spots

- Ao language is well-designed and testable
- 2v2 tournament framework is solid (just needs capacity fix)
- Rule system is modular and extensible
- Test coverage is generally good

## üéÆ Vision Alignment

### Achieved
- Command-based rules ‚úÖ
- Struct-of-arrays optimization ‚úÖ
- DSL for abilities ‚úÖ
- Folk system with single abilities ‚úÖ

### Missing
- Hero system ‚ùå
- Megabeast mechanics ‚ùå
- Environment features ‚ùå
- Visual/audio systems ‚ùå
- Flav integration ‚ùå

## Conclusion

The TypeScript simulation is a solid foundation but needs critical performance fixes and integration with the Ruby pipeline to achieve the full vision. The immediate priority should be fixing the getAllUnits performance issue and unit array capacity, then building the bridge to flav/aura for true generative gameplay.
